This dir contains a python module containing utilities for analysis and/or
postprocessing of simulation data. The utilities make use of a C/C++ library
for some of the heavy lifting, so that they are not too slow.

Requirements:
Python 3 (2 is no longer supported.)
numpy
scipy
ctypes
a C/C++ compiler (clang and gcc work)

License stuff:
This package is released under the Unlicense, except for the gsd component
which is under a 2-clause BSD-style license. See ../c_lib/gsd/LICENSE for
more info.
