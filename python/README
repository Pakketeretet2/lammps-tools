This is a set of python utilities for analysis/postprocessing of lammps data.
The utilities make use of a C/C++ library for some of the heavy lifting, so
that they are not too slow.

Requirements:
Python 2 (I've only used 2.7, so that one works)
numpy
scipy
ctypes
a C/C++ compiler (clang and gcc work)

License stuff:
Since LAMMPS is GPLv2, it makes most sense to "release" this software under
that license as well, even though it is only for internal use at the moment.
