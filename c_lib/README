This dir contains all the cpp files that make up the functions of the
library that I thought were too slow in Python. You can run them by
loading the shared object built from all these sources. Note that because
Python really only supports a C-style library, the interfaces (i.e., the
stuff you would actually call from python) need to be wrapped in an
'extern "C" { ... }'.

Note that for some features it uses boost::python, make sure you have that.
