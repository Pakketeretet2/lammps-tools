\section intro_sec Introduction
LAMMPS-Tools consists of two parts: A bunch of python tools and a C++ library
backend. The C++ part does the "heavy lifting" through a minimal C interface.
This interface can also be used for use in other C/C++ programs.

I aim to provide a complete documentation of both sides as best as I can.

For the Python documentation, see <a href="../../html/index.html">the Python docs</a>.
