  @brief The C++-side of LAMMPS-Tools

  This is the C++ library of LAMMPS-Tools. It contains functions that
  do the "heavy" lifting side of the analysis, e.g. computing radial
  distribution functions.

  \defgroup misc
  @brief Useful C++ stuff not directly related to LAMMPS-Tools

  This group contains some misc things that are used by the C++ lib
  but not really part of it.
